# GENERAL OVERVIEW
Microsoft is looking into joining the film production industry , however in order gauge whether or not it should invest into this industry it requires research on how much they will gain from doing so. Microsoft requires to know the amount of financial effort that  goes into film production as well as which type of films have a high probabilty of generating maximum profits.

# BUSINESS PROBLEM
The movie industry is highly competitive as there are well establish companies which have dominated the film industry.Microsoft requires enough information on how it can start and run successfuly in such a competitive industry.The information can best be obtained by analyzing data from various sources that highlight key points on how much money that goes into filming and the best performing films in the market.
# DATA 
Here three datasets were taken into consideration
1.IMDB
2.The numbers
3.Box office mojo
Each of the datasets provided descriptive statistics which we used to shape our conclusion.
# METHODS 
From the IMDB dataset we extracted information on which genre does had a high vote count as well as high ratings.The numbers dataset provided the average production budget , this was obtained by getting the mean of the production budget.We also obtained the average return on interest which is obtained by getting the average worldwide gross after subtracting the production budget.The box office dataset provided the mean foreign and domestic gross.

 # RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
 The results were as follows; 1.most popular genre - Romance,Sci-Fi and Thriller
                              2.Average production budget - 31,587,760
                              3.Average return on interest - 59,682,180
From the numbers dataset we observe that a low production budget leads to little or no return , on the other hand, the higher the production budget the higher the worldwide gross.However we also learn that a high production budget does not necessarily lead to a higher rate of interest. Secondly even though the worldwide gross increases with the production budget , it can be concluded that the return on interest will not be affected by increasing the production budget.Finally the from the datasets we were able to see the correlation between the worldwide gross and the production budget.
